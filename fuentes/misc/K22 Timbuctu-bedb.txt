K22 Timbuctu is based on Timbuctu from page 95 of Special Effects and 
Topical Alphabets: 100 Complete Fonts by Dan X. Solo (Dover Publications, 
1978)

The letters B/b, D/d, H/h, J/j, P/p, Q/q, V/v, X/x and Z/z have similar 
characters. All the rest have different characters for the lowercase and 
uppercase. There is a third set of letters as follows:

  alternate E in { key
  alternate G in } key
  alternate L in [ key
  alternate R in ] key

There is also an alternate for 3 in # key (or Shift 3) which looks like the 
Z/z character.

All the characters in the font came from the Timbuctu page except for letter
'w' which is my modification of the character in 'W'.

K22 Timbuctu should not be included in internet font archives without my
expressed permission. Email me if you want to add K22 Timbuctu to your site.
However, Fonts2U should not bother asking as I am not allowing my fonts to
be hosted by that site. If you see K22 Timbuctu, or any of my fonts, on that
site means that Fonts2U has no respect for creators of fonts.

K22 Timbuctu is free for personal, non-commercial use. Email if you want to
use this font commercially and let me know how you are going to use the
font.

Thanks to mindofone for the high resolution scan of Timbuctu.
